# Milestone Project One

## Morten Johansson || Personal Website

### Project Overview

This is my first milestone project for Code Institute's Full-stack Developer bootcamp.
For this project the requirements were to use only HTML and CSS(SASS for modular and file structure) to make the website.
Other technologies used: None

For this project I decided to make my own Website for my upcoming projects and past projects.
I will be a static website. It will be used as my own resume for job-hunting and acquiring potential freelance clients.

I tested this website through dev tools to check the responsiveness.

- Safari for mobile

**Devices**

- Desktop
- Iphone 5/SE

- iPad/Ipad Pro
- Pixel 2/2XL
- Galaxy S5

During the testing I found no issues and it was responsive on all mentioned above.

**Contact Form**
During testing of the contact section I noticed the submit button sent users to the top of the page. Due to deadline constraint I did not find a solution to this problem and made the submit button into an inert button and will attemt to fix before a proper live launch of the site.

**HTML and CSS Validation**
I ran both HTML and the compiled sass and recieved no errors.
